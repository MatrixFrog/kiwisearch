This is just a simple OpenSearch plugin for my favorite Javadoc site, [kiwidoc](http://www.kiwidoc.com/java/info/about). This allows you to search kiwidoc's extensive [collection of Java documention](http://www.kiwidoc.com/java/l/p/) through the Firefox search bar. [Click here to install it](http://matrixfrog.github.com/kiwisearch/install_kiwisearch.htm). See this [uservoice thread](http://kiwidoc.uservoice.com/forums/102541-general/suggestions/1508815-firefox-search-plug-in) for more discussion.

Enjoy!
